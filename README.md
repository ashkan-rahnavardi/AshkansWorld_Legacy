# First iteration of AshkansWorld

## About

This was my first attempt at making my own portfolio website. I created my own boilerplate to deepen my understanding of web serving processes and to avoid the bloat associated with 'create-react-app'.

## Features 
- **Single Page Application**: All resources needed are only loaded once throughout the lifespan of the application. 
- **Swipeable Pages**: On mobile users can swipe horizontally through the pages
- **Dynamic Components**: All of the project pages are dynamically rendered from a single JSON

## Technologies Used
- Webpack 
- Babel 
- SCSS
- React
