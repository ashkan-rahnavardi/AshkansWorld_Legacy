				"title": "Scope",
				"text": "This project was developed as a proof of concept wayfinding application for the BCIT Burnaby campus. My team consisted of myself and two other students, and we were given 4 x 1 week sprints for development.",
				"text2": "The main focus of the project was developing a way to get accurate foot path data from the campus, and creating a frontend which would use this data to show the shortest path between any two given points. "
